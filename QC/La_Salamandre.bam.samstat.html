			 * Right, this is really confusing and there is a lot of maths going on here
			 * The gist of the problem is here: https://gist.github.com/nnnick/696cc9c55f4b0beb8fe9
			 *
			 * Reaction: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34601363/toomuchscience.gif
			 *
			 * Solution:
			 *
			 * We assume the radius of the polygon is half the size of the canvas at first
			 * at each index we check if the text overlaps.
			 *
			 * Where it does, we store that angle and that index.
			 *
			 * After finding the largest index and angle we calculate how much we need to remove
			 * from the shape radius to move the point inwards by that x.
			 *
			 * We average the left and right distances to get the maximum shape radius that can fit in the box
			 * along with labels.
			 *
			 * Once we have that, we can find the centre point for the chart, by taking the x text protrusion
			 * on each side, removing that from the size, halving it and adding the left x protrusion width.
			 *
			 * This will mean we have a shape fitted to the canvas, as large as it can be with the labels
			 * and position it in the most space efficient manner
			 *

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The vast amount of data produced by next-generation sequencing machines necesitates the development of efficient visualization tools. SAMStat addresses the basic need to display information about the obtained reads both quickly and in a concise form.</p> <p>The plots on this page were draw using the excellent <a href="http://www.chartjs.org">Chartjs library</a>.</p>
